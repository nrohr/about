I've found these links to be useful in my research. Maybe you will, too. (In progress)

### Data Analysis

I use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for all of my analyses.

I create all of my figures with the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) package. The [documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) is very helpful.

I've found that the very best way to present your analyses to someone else is through [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create PDFs, Word documents, or [html pages](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html). I use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create publicly accessible webpages from markdown (including this one!)

For Bayesian analyses, [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/rstan.html). [This](https://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/learn/IntroBayes.pdf) is a very good guide to using it that draws on Gelman et al.'s _Bayesian Data Analysis_ textbook.

[John Kruschke's textbook](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/) is also good for Bayesian data analysis.

[Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R by Chihara & Hesterberg](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Resampling-Laura-Chihara/dp/1118029852) is a good introduction to resampling methods in R.

### Math/Statistics

If you need a refresher on linear algebra, [this course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm) by Gilbert Strang is helpful. The lectures are old, but luckily the basics of linear algebra haven't changed much since 1999.

Scott Fortmann-Roe has two excellent posts on [understanding the bias-variance tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) and [measuring model prediction error](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/MeasuringError.html).

### Psychology

[These videos](http://www.psych.umn.edu/meehlvideos.php) of some old lectures by Paul Meehl on philosophical psychology are great.

The [Society for Judgment & Decision Making listserv](http://mail.sjdm.org/mailman/listinfo/jdm-society) is always full of good links, discussion, and job openings in JDM research.

[Classics in the history of psychology](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/)
