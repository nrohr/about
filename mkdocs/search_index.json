            "text": "Research\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm interested in how people influence each other's attitudes, beliefs, and decisions. In my work, I combine approaches from the fields individual differences research, social and cognitive psychology, judgment and decision-making, and social networks to understand the emergent large-scale effects of individuals interacting with one another in homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent research topics\n\n\n\n\nMoral Dynamics\n\n\nHow do communities and societies develop differing systems of morality? Using \nMoral Foundations Theory\n as a taxonomy of individual differences in moral beliefs, Alin Coman and I are studying how preferences for the stories people seek and consume relate to which stories they choose to share with others. A novel experimental design that mimics the natural exchange of moral information in conversation, while tightly controlling initial conditions, allows me to answer questions such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the exchange of moral information in homogeneous groups lead people to construct biased sets of information from which they learn about others' moral beliefs? (similar to \nfilter bubbles\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo individuals' preferences for certain kinds of narratives about morality change when they exchange information with similar (vs. dissimilar) others?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan the social dynamics of moral information exchange explain why liberals and conservatives hold different beliefs about the relative importance of individualizing and binding moral foundations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Reactions to the Psychology of Poverty\n\n\nA growing body of research describes the detrimental effects of poverty on cognition, showing that people perform worse on tests of general cognitive ability and cognitive control when resources are scarce than when they are abundant (Shah, Mullainathan, \n Shafir, 2012; Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, \n Zhao, 2013). These cognitive costs of scarcity can help explain why people who are poor tend to save too little, borrow too much, fail to enroll in assistance programs, display steeper discounting rates, and many other detrimental behaviors that might result from burdened cognitive ability.\n\n\nThis view of the poor and their decision-making - that people make faulty decisions about how to manage their time and money \nbecause\n they are poor - directly contrasts with a more traditional view that faulty decision-making \ncauses\n people to fall into poverty.\n\n\nIn my research on this topic with Eldar Shafir and Alin Coman, I seek to understand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the endorsement of one view of the poor and their decision-making or the other predict support for policies that combat poverty? (including traditional programs such as the EITC or SNAP and \"nudges\" like automatic enrollment in assistance programs or savings plans)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do people respond to learning about the psychology of scarcity? Do they polarize in their beliefs along ideologically consistent trajectories, or do they shift their beliefs toward the view implied by the science of scarcity? Does their support for anti-poverty policies also shift along with their endorsement of one view or the other?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes framing scientific communication about the psychology of scarcity and proposed public policies (e.g. as ideologically motivated or neutral, libertarian or paternalistic, beneficial to all or only some) exacerbate or attenuate these effects on beliefs and policy support?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does social interaction in homogeneous or heterogeneous networks exacerbate or attenuate these effects? The study of science communication often ignores the fact that very, very few people learn about science directly from carefully-crafted communications from scientists, and very few people learn about government policies directly from policy-makers. Rather, most people will learn about science and public policies indirectly through conversing with friends, family, and acquaintances in their social networks. These conversational networks may often consist of others with similar political beliefs, and similar responses to information about the science or the policies may amplify effects on beliefs and policy support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope to answer these questions through a combination of traditional survey methods, experimental studies of interaction in social networks, and \ndiffusion-chain\n studies.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifiable Victims of Climate Change\n\n\nThe \nidentifiable victim effect\n (IVE) is almost \ntwenty years old\n, but the vast majority of published studies measured hypothetical responses to contrived scenarios in small samples of undergraduate students. Despite the seemingly widespread application of the effect by charitable organizations, \nonly very recently\n have researchers begun to study real behavior in large, representative samples.\n\n\nClimate change presents a unique challenge for the IVE, as its most vulnerable victims are located in the future and clustered in specific geographic regions of poorer countries. The temporal and social distance of the victims of climate change, along with the fact that cutting carbon emissions is a social dilemma, means that applying the IVE to increase pro-environmental behavior that combats climate change is possibly the toughest test of the effect yet.\n\n\nSander van der Linden\n, Nicky Robinson, and I are conducting several studies that test the effects of highlighting the suffering of individual victims of climate change on concern about climate change and pro-environmental behavior in large, nationally representative samples.\n\n\n\n\nThe Majority Illusion and the Social Amplification of Risk\n\n\nThe \nmajority illusion in social networks\n is a phenomenon through which individuals occupying high-degree nodes of social networks might exert influence through the overestimation of consensus by others in the network. Initially proposed as a mathematical description of the structure and dynamics of networks, researchers have now begun to collect \nempirical evidence\n supporting the effect.\n\n\nThe \nsocial amplification of risk\n (SAR) is a decades-old framework that describes how risk perceptions can be amplified through social interaction and media consumption, sometimes leading to widespread destructive panic about risks that pose little threat. However, the SAR framework has long ignored the structure of social networks through which beneficial and harmful risk perceptions propagate.\n\n\nWith Alin Coman, I am conducting experimental studies where we construct small social networks with unequal degree distributions and expose participants to biased information emphasizing the benefits or costs of relatively unknown technologies (e.g., CRISPR). Through this biased information exposure, we can predictably shift participant's risk perceptions and then allow them to interact via natural conversation in the network to see if imbuing certain risk perceptions in high-degree nodes leads other participants in the network to shift their risk perceptions toward those of participants in high-degree nodes.",

I spend most of my weekdays in Princeton at the beautiful new Peretsman-Scully Hall and Princeton Neuroscience Institute. It's amazing to feel like I live both in a large bustling city and a small quiet town, both with an enormous amount of history.\n\n\n\n\nSteph is a fourth-grade teacher at a small charter school in southwest Philadelphia. There is perhaps no more important place to apply psychology than in the classroom, and I credit Steph for being the primary influence of my interest in applied psychology.\n\n\n\n\nSome might say that it's crazy to make a deliberate decision to have a child in grad school. I suppose I'll soon find out if they're right! I think someone once said something about not being able to have it all, but I'll be damned if I won't try and end up with at least most of it. I'm very grateful to have a huge support network of friends and family, and to attend a university that's relatively (\nrelatively!\n) generous with the stipend it provides us.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I'm not working on research, I enjoy watching the NFL (Ravens) and NBA (76ers... I know...), reading about psychology, politics, and economics, and spending time with my growing family.",
