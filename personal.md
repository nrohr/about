<br/>

I live in Philadelphia, PA with my wife [Stephanie](http://fourthfizz.blogspot.com/), Shiba Inu dog Audrey, cat Fifi, and soon-to-be-born son Calvin. I spend most of my weekdays in Princeton at the beautiful new Peretsman-Scully Hall and Princeton Neuroscience Institute. It's amazing to feel like I live both in a large bustling city and a small quiet town, both with an enormous amount of history.

<br/>

Steph is a fourth-grade teacher at a small charter school in southwest Philadelphia. There is perhaps no more important place to apply psychology than in the classroom, and I credit Steph for being the primary influence of my interest in applied psychology.

Some might say that it's crazy to make a deliberate decision to have a child in grad school. I suppose I'll soon find out if they're right! I think someone once said something about not being able to have it all, but I'll be damned if I won't try and end up with at least most of it. I'm very grateful to have a huge support network of friends and family, and to attend a university that's relatively (_relatively!_) generous with the stipend it provides us.

<br/>

When I'm not working on research, I enjoy watching the NFL (Ravens) and NBA (76ers, I know...), reading about psychology, politics, and economics, and spending time with my growing family.
