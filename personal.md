<br/>

I live in Philadelphia, PA with my wife [Stephanie](http://fourthfizz.blogspot.com/), Shiba Inu dog Audrey, cat Fifi, and soon-to-be-born son Calvin.

<br/>

Steph is a fourth-grade teacher at a small charter school in southwest Philadelphia. There is perhaps no more important place to apply psychology than in the classroom, and I credit Steph for being the primary influence of my interest in applied psychology.

<br/>

When I'm not working on research, I enjoy watching the NFL (Ravens) and NBA (76ers), reading about psychology, politics, and economics, and spending time with my growing family.
